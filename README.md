# HSC
This is a Hero System speed Chart program.  It allows the Hero System GM to more easily run combat for the game.  It also loads the .hsc files from the Hero System
Character Creaator program and displays each characters image and abilities (sans points).  This allows the GM to stay on top of what characters can do and look things up as 
needed.  It's not perfect, but it shouldn't crash when it runs into something it's never seen before.

It is built with the Qt toolkit and runs under windows and soon linux. Mac would me nice, but I don't have a mac to compile with (I refuse to jump on the Apple bandwagon
again after they made my investment obsolete on thier terms not mine).

Bug reports welcome, but won't be acted on unless I feel like it ;-) and I reserve the right to delete anything I don't like :-D
